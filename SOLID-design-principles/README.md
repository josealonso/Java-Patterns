## The SOLID Principles

There is a package for each principle with simple examples.

### Single Responsability Principle

- Every Java class must perform a single functionality.

### Open-Closed Principle

- The module should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### Liskov Substitution Principle

- It applies to inheritance in such a way that the **derived classes must be completely substitutable for their base classes**.

### Interface Segregation Principle

- Larger interfaces must split into smaller ones.
We should not force the client to use the methods that they do not want to use.
The goal of this principle is similat to that of the single responsability principle.

### Dependency Inversion Principle

- We should use abstraction (abstract classes and interfaces) instead of concrete implementations.
